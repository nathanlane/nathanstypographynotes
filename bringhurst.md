# 1\. The Grand Design: Core Principles & Tactics

## 1.1 First Principles

  * **Typography exists to honor content.** The primary goal is to clarify, honor, and share the meaning of the text. Typography should aspire to a statuesque transparency, relinquishing the attention it has drawn. [cite: 36, 37]
  * **Durable typography is legible and has an energy that gives life to the page.** This can be serenity, liveliness, laughter, grace, or joy. [cite: 38]
  * **Letters have a life and dignity of their own.** Well-chosen words deserve well-chosen letters, set with affection, intelligence, knowledge, and skill. [cite: 44]
  * **Typography is idealized writing.** Its task is to give the illusion of superhuman patience and precision to the writing hand. [cite: 47, 48]
  * **There is a style beyond style.** This is the power to move freely through the whole domain of typography in a way that is graceful and vital, not banal. It means breaking the rules beautifully, deliberately, and well. [cite: 17, 18, 51]

## 1.2 Tactics & Process

  * **Read the text before designing it.** The typographer's essential task is to interpret and communicate the text. Its tone, tempo, and logical structure determine the typographic form. [cite: 57]
  * **Discover the outer logic of the typography in the inner logic of the text.** Analyze and map the text's structure (chapters, sections, subheads, lists, etc.) before beginning interpretation. [cite: 58, 59]
  * **Make the visible relationship between elements a reflection of their real relationship.** The placement of notes, images, captions, and other elements must be logical and consistent with their role in the text. [cite: 65]
  * **Choose a typeface that will honor and elucidate the character of the text.** When type is poorly chosen, what the words say linguistically and what the letters imply visually are disharmonious. [cite: 70, 75]
  * **Shape the page and frame the textblock to honor and reveal every element and logical nuance.** The page shape and type placement should be as carefully considered as the typeface itself. [cite: 76]
  * **Give full typographic attention to incidental details.** Page numbers, textual notes, copyright claims, and other paraphernalia can be made into poignant and lovely typography. [cite: 80, 81, 82]

# 2\. Rhythm & Proportion

## 2.1 Horizontal Motion: Characters, Words & Lines

### 2.1.1 Spacing

  * **Define the word space to suit the font.** For a normal text face, a typical word space is a quarter of an em (`M/4`). [cite: 93]
  * **For justified text, aim for M/4 spacing.** The acceptable range is typically a minimum of `M/5` and a maximum of `M/2`. Holding the maximum to `M/3` is even better. [cite: 95]
  * **Use a single word space between sentences.** The habit of inserting two spaces after a period is a quaint Victorian practice that should be unlearned. [cite: 110, 111]
  * **Add little or no space within strings of initials.** Use hair spaces, thin spaces, or no space at all within names like `W.B. Yeats`. [cite: 119]
  * **Never stretch space until it breaks.** In lists (like a table of contents), align elements flush left and flush right against each other rather than using dot leaders or creating wide chasms of space. [cite: 153, 154]

### 2.1.2 Measure (Line Length)

  * **Choose a comfortable measure.** For a single-column page in a serifed text face, 45 to 75 characters is a satisfactory line length. [cite: 97]
  * The ideal line has 66 characters (counting letters and spaces). [cite: 97]
  * For multi-column work, a better average is 40 to 50 characters. [cite: 97]
  * For justified text, the working minimum is a 40-character line to avoid erratic word spacing and excessive hyphenation. [cite: 99]

### 2.1.3 Letterspacing

  * **Letterspace all strings of capitals and small caps.** Normal letterspacing for acronyms (`CIA`, `NATO`) is 5% to 10% of the type size. [cite: 120]
  * **Letterspace all long strings of digits.** Spacing is essential for reading long serial numbers and helpful for phone numbers and dates. [cite: 124, 125]
  * **Do not letterspace the lowercase without a compelling reason.** As Frederic Goudy said, "A man who would letterspace lower case would steal sheep." It hampers legibility. [cite: 126]
      * An exception can be made for condensed, unserifed lowercase in display contexts or for web/e-mail addresses where letters function individually. [cite: 127, 131]

### 2.1.4 Kerning

  * **Kern consistently and modestly or not at all.** Too little kerning is preferable to too much, and inconsistent kerning is worse than none. [cite: 134, 135]
  * Numbers often need more kerning than letters. Proportional figures are preferred over tabular figures for running text. [cite: 141, 142]
  * Be mindful of language-specific kerning needs (e.g., French elisions like `l'a` vs. English contractions like `'tis`). [cite: 144]

### 2.1.5 Letterforms

  * **Do not alter the widths or shapes of letters without cause.** Arbitrarily condensing or expanding letters is the poorest method for fitting copy. [cite: 149]

### 2.1.6 Ragged vs. Justified Text

  * **Set ragged-right when it suits the text.** Use for narrow measures (e.g., in multi-column layouts), many unserifed faces, and all monospaced (typewriter) fonts. [cite: 104, 106, 107]
  * **Aim for a "hard rag."** This means using fixed word spaces, no hyphenation (unless inherent in the word), and no minimum line length. This avoids the artificial, pinched-piecrust look of much software-generated ragged text. [cite: 108, 109]

## 2.2 Vertical Motion: Leading

  * **Choose a basic leading that suits the typeface, text, and measure.** Most text requires positive leading (e.g., 10/12). Darker faces, large-bodied faces, and longer lines need more lead. [cite: 162]
  * **Add and delete vertical space in measured intervals.** The space taken by headings, block quotes, and other interruptions must be an even multiple of the basic leading of the main text, ensuring the text returns to the grid precisely on beat. [cite: 168, 169]

## 2.3 Paragraphs & Block Quotes

  * **Set opening paragraphs flush left.** The indent is to mark a pause; if the paragraph is preceded by a title or subhead, the indent is superfluous. [cite: 176]
  * **Indent all subsequent paragraphs in continuous text.** A standard indent is one em. One en is the practical minimum. [cite: 181]
  * **Mark block quotations clearly from the main text.** This can be done by changing the face (roman to italic), size (11pt to 10pt), or through indentation. Ensure there is a visible distinction (e.g., a white line) before and after the quote. [cite: 183, 185]
  * **Indent or center verse quotations.** To distinguish verse from prose, it should be indented or centered on its longest line. [cite: 189]

## 2.4 Hyphenation & Pagination Etiquette

  * **At line-ends, leave at least two characters behind and take at least three forward.** (`Fi-nally` is acceptable; `final-ly` is not). [cite: 195]
  * **Avoid more than three consecutive hyphenated lines.** [cite: 196]
  * **Avoid leaving a stub-end of a hyphenated word as the last line of a paragraph.** [cite: 195]
  * **Never begin a page with the last line of a paragraph (an orphan).** [cite: 200]
  * **Avoid ending a page on the first line of a paragraph (a widow).** Give it at least one more line for company. [cite: 203]
  * **Balance facing pages by moving single lines.** Export or import lines to and from adjacent spreads to fix widows and balance page depth. A spread should never be more than one line short or long. [cite: 204, 205]
  * **Hyphenate proper names only as a last resort.** [cite: 196]
  * **Link short numerical and mathematical expressions with hard spaces** to prevent linebreaks (e.g., in `6.2 mm` or `page 3`). [cite: 198, 199]
  * **Abandon any rule that fails to serve the needs of the text.** [cite: 193]

# 3\. Choosing & Combining Type

## 3.1 Size and Scale

  * **Compose with a typographic scale.** Start with a modest set of distinct, related intervals. The traditional scale is: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36 points. [cite: 210, 211, 212]

## 3.2 Figures & Capitals

  * **Use text figures (old-style) in running text.** Text figures (`1234567890`) integrate with lowercase letters. [cite: 217]
  * **Use titling figures with full caps.** Titling figures (`1234567890`) align with the cap height. [cite: 214, 217]
  * **Use spaced small caps for abbreviations and acronyms** in running text (e.g., `3:00 PM`, `450 BC`, `NATO`). [cite: 227]
  * **Use real small caps, not shrunken capitals.** Genuine small caps are designed from the ground up with different stroke weights and proportions. [cite: 229, 230]

## 3.3 Ligatures

  * **Use the ligatures required by the font and language.** The five standard Latin ligatures are `ff`, `fi`, `fl`, `ffi`, and `ffl`. [cite: 237, 239]
  * **If you wish to avoid ligatures, choose faces that do not require them.** Faces like Palatino, Sabon, and Trump Mediaeval set well without ligatures. [cite: 254, 255]

## 3.4 Type Families & Contrast

  * **Use sloped romans sparingly.** Understand the difference: Italic is cursive and relates to the flow of the hand; a sloped roman (oblique) is merely an inclined version of the roman. [cite: 273, 274, 280]
  * **Change only one parameter at a time for contrast.** If the text is 12pt roman, do not jump to 24pt bold italic caps for a heading. Try a single change first: larger size, or italic, or small caps. [cite: 294]
  * **Keep punctuation in the background.** When emphasizing words with **bold**, the punctuation should typically remain in the text weight. When using *italics*, the punctuation should also be italic for better fit. [cite: 296, 297]

# 4\. Analphabetic Symbols (Punctuation)

## 4.1 Dashes, Slashes & Dots

  * **Use a spaced en dash – not a close-set em dash or hyphen – to set off phrases.** [cite: 405]
  * **Use a close-set en dash or three-to-em dash for ranges of digits** (e.g., `3–6 November`). [cite: 410]
  * **Use an em dash to introduce speakers in dialogue.** `—So this is a French novel? she said.` [cite: 412]
  * **Use the virgule (/) with words and dates; use the solidus for fractions.** [cite: 415]
  * **Use ellipses that fit the font.** For text sizes, it is often better to add thin spaces between the dots. [cite: 419, 420]
  * **When an ellipsis ends a sentence, add a fourth dot (the period).** `... and so it ends....` [cite: 421]

## 4.2 Parentheses & Brackets

  * **Use upright `()` and `[]` even if the context is *italic*.** Parentheses and brackets are not letters; they are vertical punctuation. The sloped versions on italic fonts are generally less useful. [cite: 436, 438]

## 4.3 Quotation Marks

  * **Minimize the use of quotation marks.** In the Renaissance, quotation was marked by a change of font (roman to italic), not with quote marks. Use them only where they contribute real information. [cite: 441, 445]
  * **Choose a quote style and be consistent.** British style is typically single quotes first, with doubles inside: `‘So does “analphabetic” mean...?’`. American practice is the reverse. [cite: 446, 447]
  * **Use proper quotation marks (`“ ” ‘ ’ « »`), never dumb quotes (`" '`).** [cite: 1512, 1557]

## 4.4 Other Punctuation

  * **Omit the period after metric units** (`5.2 m`, `520 cm`) and other self-evident abbreviations (`Dr`, `Mr`, `St`). [cite: 452, 453]
  * **Omit periods in capitalized abbreviations** (`3:00 AM`, `450 BC`, `Washington, DC`). [cite: 454]
  * **Omit the apostrophe from numerical plurals** (`the 1930s`, `the terrible twos`). [cite: 451]

# 5\. Shaping the Page

## 5.1 Page & Textblock Proportions

  * **Choose inherently satisfying page proportions, not just stock sizes.** Proportions derived from simple geometry (the golden section, 2:3, 3:4) are often more pleasing because they recur in nature and art. [cite: 743, 744, 745, 807]
  * **The page is a proportion silently sounding the thoroughbass of the book.** The relationship between the page dimensions and the textblock dimensions creates a fundamental harmony or dissonance. [cite: 751]
  * **Shape the textblock to balance and contrast with the page.** A common Renaissance practice was to use a textblock with different (but harmonious) proportions from the page itself, creating a polyphonic geometry. [cite: 824, 825]
  * **Place the textblock high and toward the spine.** On a two-page spread, this creates horizontal symmetry while maintaining a vertical asymmetry that aids the downward flow of reading. [cite: 828, 829]

## 5.2 Margins

  * **Bring the margins into the design.** Margins should lock the textblock to the page and the facing pages to each other through their proportions. A classic medieval structure sets margins in the proportion 2:3:4:6 for spine:top:fore-edge:foot. [cite: 832, 859]
  * **Fifty percent of a printed page's character lies in its letterforms; much of the other fifty percent resides in its margins.** [cite: 833]

## 5.3 Technical Considerations

  * **Choose faces that will prosper under the final printing conditions.** Delicate faces like Bembo will be lost if printed at low resolution. [cite\\_start]Robust faces with open counters and substantial serifs (like Stone or Caecilia) survive crude conditions better. [cite: 488, 490]
  * **Choose faces that suit the paper.** Renaissance and Baroque types were designed to be pressed into robust papers. [cite\\_start]Neoclassical and Romantic types require smooth papers to preserve their fragile lines. [cite: 491, 492]
