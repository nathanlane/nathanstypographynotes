# Typography: A Manual of Design

## Core Principles

### The Purpose of Typography
- Typography has one plain duty: **to convey information in writing**
- No argument or consideration can absolve typography from this duty
- A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without purpose
- The goal is the cheapest and quickest dissemination of information
- From the invention of printing in the 15th century to the present, all efforts have been directed to disseminating information cheaply and quickly

### Typography as Craft
- Typography is more an expression of technology, precision, and good order than graphic design
- It's concerned with satisfying everyday requirements formally and functionally
- The mechanical production of type and composition within fixed dimensions demands clear structure and cleanly ordered relationships
- Typography is no longer concerned with lofty artistic demands but with satisfying the everyday requirements of a craft

### The Typographer's Role
- The typographer chooses from typefaces they have not designed themselves
- This dependence on pre-existing forms is of the essence of typography, not a limitation
- The typographer must take the impersonal view; willful individuality and emotion have little place in their work
- The sum of prefabricated elements is so large that combinations are virtually infinite
- The typographer occupies a place where they depend on others' finished work (type, paper, ink, tools, machines) and must enable subsequent processes (printing, finishing)

## Fundamentals

### The Written Character
- Writing is the foundation of all typographical activity
- The development of writing spans from early hieroglyphs to abstract written symbols
- Our reading direction (left-to-right) was developed in Early Greek lapidary writing through the boustrophedonic intermediate stage
- The evolution of written characters was concluded with Carolingian minuscule; all else is variation and confusion
- Lower-case letters with ascenders and descenders enable rapid reading when composed into words

### Historical Context
- Gothic typography bears striking similarity to other works of the same epoch
- The "yachting style" at the turn of the 20th century is reflected in Otto Eckmann's typeface
- Constructivism of the twenties manifests in Bauhaus typography
- Every period makes a solid, uniform impression when seen from a distance
- Contemporary typography cannot be segregated from the general flux of events

## Technical Considerations

### Type Technology
- Form in typography is determined by the technique of type casting
- Casting from a mold ensures the face remains absolutely unchanged through unlimited castings
- This unchanging face is of the essence of typography
- The typographer works with lead type and furniture assembled within rectangular constraints
- The right angle belongs in typography alongside the repetition of forms
- Modern film-setting allows diagonal arrangements

### Paper and Printing Process Impact
- The appearance of typography is greatly influenced by paper and printing process
- Printing on rough paper: forms expand with diffuse edges, letters lose precision and appear lighter
- Printing on glossy paper: produces precise images with clear, definite edges
- Letterpress rotary printing requires type to be molded and recast, causing some coarsening
- Gravure printing on etched screens causes loss of precision compared to letterpress
- New phototypesetting methods achieve precision never before attained

### Specific Technical Rules
- Every type character must have proper spacing to left and right
- Classical types regulate spacing through projections on the type body
- Sans-serif types require special attention to lateral spacing to avoid letters being too close
- Spacing that's too narrow creates spotty appearance when characters are set
- Well-cast characters with correct spacing should produce even grey value across the page

## Design Principles

### Form and Counter-form
- In typography, the unprinted surface is recognized as an element of design equal in value to the printed
- The typographer is familiar with white as a design value and its visual changes
- The white space inside letters participates in the letter's form
- Type designer must constantly balance form and counter-form when drawing
- Examples of counter-form importance:
  - Letter spacing provides means of reducing effect of counters
  - Narrow set width emphasizes white counters
  - Wide spacing can make harmonious balance between counter whites and spacing whites
  - Excessive leading produces white ribbon effect that dominates the grey type lines

### Hierarchy and Organization
- The typographer's primary task is sorting and organizing disparate elements
- When dealing with masses of text, division and arrangement are essential:
  - Divide book text so readers can manage each page comfortably
  - Use line lengths of 50-60 characters for easy reading
  - Apply consistent leading to ensure smooth reading flow
  - Too little leading destroys line pattern; too much exaggerates it
- Tabular works offer best opportunity to show skill in arrangement
- Use white space, rules, colors, and varying type sizes to emphasize important content

### Specific Organizational Rules
- Text relief can be achieved through:
  1. Color variation
  2. Bold and normal faces
  3. Larger type sizes
  4. Rules and lines
  5. Blank lines
  6. Break lines
- Never let purely formal requirements get out of hand
- A simple railway timetable may be better craftsmanship than jobbing work full of colors and fancy shapes

## Visual Elements

### Proportions
- No system of ratios can relieve the typographer of deciding how values relate
- The typographer must:
  - First recognize individual values before working with them
  - Spare no effort to develop feeling for proportion
  - Know intuitively when tension between elements becomes too great
  - Avoid relationships lacking tension (leading to monotony)
  - Decide if tension should be strong or weak based on the problem
- The Golden Section (3:5:8:13) may be right for one work but wrong for another
- Consider relationships between:
  - One value to another
  - Printed to unprinted areas
  - Color values to grey type matter
  - Various tones of grey to each other

### Contrasts
- Combining values according to contrast laws changes and enhances both values
- Round tree crowns appear rounder near angular buildings
- A tower appears higher in a flat landscape
- Warm colors appear warmer combined with cool colors
- Essential typographic contrasts:
  - Light-dark, thin-thick, line-surface
  - Vertical-horizontal, active-passive
  - Large-small, round-straight
  - Precise-diffuse, hard-soft
  - Static-dynamic, closed-open
  - Concentrated-scattered
  - Symmetry-asymmetry

### Grey Values
- Typography offers extensive possibilities for creating grey tones through:
  - Lines of equal thickness with different spacing
  - Lines of different thickness with same spacing
  - Screen surfaces and halftone blocks
  - Gradation of type sizes
  - Light, bold, and extra-bold cuttings
  - Variable leading with uniform composition
- Never use grey merely as decoration
- Grey must fulfill functional and formal requirements
- Handle grey tones and depth deliberately - use only when precise effect is decided

### Color in Typography
- Black is the paramount color in typography
- Red is the traditional typographic accent color since incunabula
- Use bright, gleaming, yellowish red (not dull, bluish red)
- Red dosage must not be left to chance - it can dominate even in small quantities
- Color relationships must show clear tension:
  - Small amount of red near large black area gains value and luminosity
  - Equal amounts of color create unpleasant rivalry
  - Too small red quantity gets overwhelmed by excess black
- Two-color systems (like red and grey) lack brilliance without black
- Three-color harmony (red, black, grey) provides clear relationships

## Composition Principles

### Rhythm
- Without rhythm there would be no life or creation
- Each creature passes rhythmically through stages of growth
- Typography offers many opportunities for rhythmic values:
  - Straights and curves, verticals and horizontals in typefaces
  - Alternation of ascenders and descenders
  - Round and pointed forms, symmetry and asymmetry
  - Word spaces dividing lines into unequal lengths
  - Break and blank lines adding accents
  - Graduated type sizes
- Specific rhythm techniques:
  - Vary leading to create rhythm
  - Use different line lengths
  - Distribute type matter on page format to create contrasts
  - Place square type area on rectangular paper for two-beat rhythm contrast

### Line and Surface
- Everything begins with the dot, which moves to create the line
- A row of characters produces an optical line
- Line effects in typography:
  - Pure linear effect with single lines
  - Two lines at right angles produce weak surface effect
  - Three lines produce stronger surface effect
  - Closed forms create primary surface, secondary linear effects
- Balance requirements:
  - Text set too wide degenerates into decorative grey
  - Too narrow text forces unequal word spacing and excessive hyphenation
  - Optimal legibility comes from well-balanced linear and surface effects

### Movement in Typography
- Typography is always concerned with movement in the reading direction
- Modern man experiences multiple simultaneous movements (like walking on a ship deck)
- Movement can be represented through:
  - Size increase/decrease
  - Value intensification/reduction
  - Dissolving compact elements
  - Gathering scattered values
  - Eccentric and concentric movements
  - Vertical movements (top to bottom, bottom to top)
  - Horizontal movements (left to right, right to left)
  - Diagonal movements
  - Rotational patterns

## Practical Applications

### Text Setting Rules
- **Line length**: 50-60 characters optimal for easy reading
- **Leading**: 
  - Too little destroys line pattern and readability
  - Too much creates distracting white ribbons
  - Adjust based on line length and typeface
- **Word spacing**:
  - Too narrow creates monotonous lines
  - Too wide enhances rhythm but reduces legibility
  - Maintain consistency within justified text
- **Justification alternatives**:
  - Ragged right: even spacing, uniform grey, but unfamiliar to readers
  - Ragged left: eye picks up lines differently each time, uncomfortable reading
  - Ragged both sides: makes reading difficult

### Unity and Consistency
- Integral design requirements:
  - All parts of a work should be consistently designed
  - Books need consistency in title pages, text, and covers
  - Use title page as model for typeface, size, leading, indents, type area
  - Illustration sections need consistent sizing and placement plans
- Business printing unity:
  - One firm should present uniform typographic picture
  - Apply consistency from letterhead through all printed materials
  - Use visual identity as foundation for all materials
- Series and collections:
  - Linking elements: color, publisher's mark, typeface, layout
  - Must comply with overall design while allowing individual recognition
  - Typography particularly suited for series identification

### Grid Systems
- Consistency achieved through underlying grid patterns
- Grid units (like 9 squares) provide multiple position/size options
- Each element firmly established in overall plan
- Historical precedent: St. Gall Abbey built on square-based grid
- Benefits:
  - Creates fixed relationships between all parts
  - Conveys planning and uniform purpose
  - Allows variation within structure

## Special Considerations

### Optical Adjustments
- The eye magnifies horizontal and diminishes vertical elements
- Required compensations:
  - Geometric squares must be slightly heightened to appear square
  - When divided horizontally, lower half appears smaller
  - Thick horizontal bars look fatter than equal vertical bars
  - Vertical thick bars appear affected by gravity
  - Black squares reduce optically to rounded points
  - Circles appear wider than tall
  - Triangles base-down look stable; inverted appear unstable

### Geometric vs. Organic
- Geometry alone insufficient for well-shaped letters
- Lateral projections can't be added mechanically with compass
- Transitions from round to straight need manual adjustment
- Type design requires:
  - External circles drawn less than geometric perfection
  - Horizontal strokes substantially thinned
  - Width less than height for optical balance

### Integration of Text and Image
- Eastern art achieves unity through same tools for both
- Western culture uses different processes, making harmony difficult
- Strategies for combining:
  - Match stroke weights between image and type
  - Align structural patterns
  - Create formal relationships through spacing
  - Use deliberate contrast when harmony impossible
- Consider:
  - Heavy images need robust type
  - Delicate drawings work with light typefaces
  - Diffuse images contrast well with precise type

### Language and Typography
- International contacts leave no scope for pronounced national character in type
- Neutral typeface, aloof from national considerations, already partly reality
- Different languages affect typographic appearance:
  - German with many capitals creates different texture
  - French and Italian flow more smoothly
  - Consider language when selecting typefaces
- Modern communication demands type that works across languages

## Professional Standards

### Quality Criteria
- Good typography subordinates form to legibility
- Technical correctness precedes aesthetic considerations
- Every decision should enhance communication
- Function determines form, not vice versa
- Avoid using grey values merely for decoration
- Color must serve clear purpose, not whim

### Contemporary Requirements
- Modern typography must handle:
  - Enormous flood of printed matter
  - Need for quick identification and scanning
  - Multiple simultaneous messages
  - International communication
  - Digital and traditional printing methods
- Discipline, coolness, and objectivity remain typography's features
- Typography's nature largely determined by technical and functional dependencies

### The Typographer's Mindset
- Think in terms of relationships, not isolated elements
- Consider technical possibilities and limitations
- Respect reader's needs above personal expression
- Understand historical context while addressing present needs
- Balance innovation with proven principles
- Accept that typography serves communication first

## Experimental Approaches

### Spontaneity and Chance
- Generally contradicts typography's essential clarity and precision
- Latest technical developments open some possibilities:
  - Film-setting allows free manipulation
  - Hand printing creates pressure variations
  - Chemical treatments alter appearance
  - Unusual page impositions possible
- When used, must serve clear communicative purpose
- Discipline and objectivity remain paramount

### Variations and Series
- Same content can receive multiple treatments
- Title pages can vary through line arrangement alone
- Maintain constants (typeface, size) while varying position
- Useful for:
  - Programme series
  - Advertising campaigns
  - Exhibition materials
  - Corporate communications
